	1. Open MusicStore.sln in Visual Studio 2015 and run the individual applications on `IIS Express`.
* If you don't have Visual Studio 2015
	1. Open a command prompt and execute `cd \src\MusicStore\`.
	2. Execute `dnu restore`.
	3. Execute `Helios.cmd` to launch the app on IISExpress from command line (Application started at URL **http://localhost:5001/**).
	   
**NOTE:** App and tests require Visual Studio 2015 LocalDB on the machine to run.

## Run on WebListener/Kestrel:
* Open a command prompt and cd `\src\MusicStore\`.
* **[WebListener]:**
	4. Run `dnx . web` (Application started at URL **http://localhost:5002/**).
* **[Kestrel]:**
	5. Run `dnx . kestrel` (Application started at URL **http://localhost:5004/**).
* **[CustomHost]:**
	6. Run `dnx . run` (This hosts the app in a console application - Application started at URL **http://localhost:5003/**).

## To run the sample on Mac/Mono:
* Follow the instructions at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) repository to install Mono and DNVM on Mac OS X.
* Open a command prompt and execute `cd \src\MusicStore\`.
* Execute `dnu restore`.
* Try `dnx . kestrel` to run the application.

**NOTE:** Since on Mono SQL client is not available the sample uses an InMemoryStore to run the application. So the changes that you make will not be persisted.
